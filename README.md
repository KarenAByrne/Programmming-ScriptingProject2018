## Iris Data set background ##

Fisher's Iris Data set is a widely used data set for members of the Data Analytiocs community. (1)

Fisher was a British statistician and biologist of the early 1900's.

The data consists of 4 types of easurements taken in cms from 3 variations of Iris flower, namely
Sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The data set contains 50 samples from 
each of the 3 iris species in question Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.

The data set is comma delimited. It contains 150 rows and 5 columns of data. The first 4 columns are 
measurements in centimetres of parts of the flower, the final column is the species name.

## Running the files ##

For this analysis, run the file Irisdata.py which is in the python language v3.6. Libraries 
and modules required to run the code are mathplotlib, seaborn and numpy. The file returns the Mean,
max and min of each oart of the flower for each species. It also produces a graph to show notable clusters
within these measurements.

According to writeups there are 2 clusters in the data which I intended to illustrate by producing graphs 
of the data.See Seaborn.py. 

I have found the max min and mean of each of the four measurements taken for each species. See output of irisdata.py.

I want to plot the measurements on a graph with a different colour for each species to investigate any correlations.
Through some research I found that the module Seaborn is useful for this in conjunction with matplotlib. It enhances 
the look and feel of the graphs to make them more viualy appealing and easier to read.

## Results ##

Measurement (cm) |Setosa|Versicolor|Virginica
-----|----|-----------
**Mean Sepal Length**|5.006|6.602|5.941.
**Mean Sepal Width**|3.418|2.973|2.769.
**Mean Petal Length**|1.464|5.561|4.263.
**Mean Sepal Width**|0.244|2.031|1.327.





## Conclusion: ##

This project has presented a steep learning curve for many aspects of computing.  I have downloaded Anaconda. discovered
that the libraries I weanted to use, mathplotlib and numpy, come with this and I had to download Pandas. Even so far as 
using the command line as Admin so I could actually install Pandas.
