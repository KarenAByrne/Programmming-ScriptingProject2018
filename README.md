Iris Data set background

Fisher's Iris Data set is a widely used data set for members of the Data Analytiocs community

Fisher was a British statistician and biologist of the early 1900's.

The data consists of 4 types of easurements taken in cms from 3 variations of Iris flower, namely
Sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The data set contains 50 samples from 
each of the 3 iris species in question Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.

I have found the mean of each of the four measurements taken.

I want to plot the measurements on a graph with a different colour for each species to investigate any correlations.
