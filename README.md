Iris Data set background

Fisher's Iris Data set is a widely used data set for members of the Data Analytiocs community

Fisher was a British statistician and biologist of the early 1900's.

The data consists of 4 types of easurements taken in cms from 3 variations of Iris flower, namely
Sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. The data set contains 50 samples from 
each of the 3 iris species in question Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor.

The data set is comma delimited. It contains 150 rows and 5 columns of data. The first 4 columns are 
measurements in centimetres of parts of the flower, the final column is the species name.



According to writeups there are 2 clusters in the data which I intend illustrate by producing graphs 
of the data.

I have found the mean of each of the four measurements taken.

I want to plot the measurements on a graph with a different colour for each species to investigate any correlations.

The Max and Mean of each column have been calculated. 

This project has presented a steep learning curve for many aspects of computing.  I have downloaded Anaconda. discovered
that the libraries I weanted to use, mathplotlib and numpy, come with this and I had to download Pandas. Even so far as 
using the command line as Admin so I could actually install Pandas.
